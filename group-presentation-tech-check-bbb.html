        <p>This activity is designed to familiarize you with a video-conferencing tool, BigBlueButton, which you will use to facilitate and record a <span class="span-id-note">video group assignment in the coming modules. Additionally, BigBlueButton will be used for portions of your final assignment in this course [NOTE TO INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGNER: Adapt this language as suits your course]</span>.</p>
        <p>Here, you have the opportunity to practice using the tool, in a relatively low-stakes activity. Because the conferencing technology may be unfamiliar to you, we want to alleviate any concerns your team may have with it prior to the critical recording session for your group assignment.</p>
        <p>For this activity, your team will prepare a conference, perform a sound and video check, record a brief introduction&mdash;no longer than a minute, and submit the URL to your recording.</p>
        <h2>Details</h2>
        <p>Along with your fellow group member(s), record a one-minute-long video in BigBlueButton, via the Conferences tool in your <a class="" title="" href="https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/groups">Canvas group</a>. Your video does not need to be complicated&mdash;a simple sound and video check along with a greeting to the instructor will do&mdash;but each group member should appear on webcam and speak.</p>
        <p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: To record a conference, you <em>MUST</em> select the<em> "Enable recording for this conference"</em> option when you initially create the conference. Otherwise, once the conference has started, it will not record, even if you go back and edit the conference.</strong></p>
        <p>You will record your tech check using <strong>Conferences</strong> inside your group work space. Click <strong>Groups</strong> in the Canvas global navigation menu to locate your group. Designate one member of the group to be responsible for creating the conferences under the <strong>Conferences</strong> link in the Group navigation.</p>
        <p><strong>Please carefully review the Canvas guide: </strong><a class="" title="" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-1837">How do I record a conference in a student group?</a></p>

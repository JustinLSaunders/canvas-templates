            <p>Your team has a dedicated, private workspace that you can access via <a href="https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/groups">Canvas groups</a>. In that space, you can hold meetings with your teammates using the conferencing tool, BigBlueButton. BigBlueButton allows you to see and hear each other via your computer's webcam and microphone and to discuss shared documents, presentations, and other files. You can also choose to record and save your BigBlueButton conferences.</p>
            <p>Within the collaborations section of your group space you have access to shared Google Docs, which allows multiple users to work together on the same document simultaneously. Collaborative documents are saved in real-time; a change made by any user will be immediately visible to everyone.</p>
            <p>You can also share files and resources, make announcements to teammates, host your own private team discussions, and even build wiki pages for your team. Outside of the required group work, how you use the space is up to you.</p>

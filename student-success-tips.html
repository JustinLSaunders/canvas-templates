                <p>If this is your first online course, congratulations! You&rsquo;re about to enter a unique learning environment: one that leverages technology to enhance the course&rsquo;s flexibility and outcomes for students (you!).</p>
                <p>As you prepare for your course, there are some best practices, listed below, that can help you excel. As you read through them, consider: <strong>what strategies can you implement now to ensure your own success?</strong></p>
                <h2>Structure</h2>
                <p>The increased flexibility of an online course will likely help it better fit into your daily life. However, online courses still require a real commitment of time and energy. By purposefully structuring your work habits now, you&rsquo;ll be able to learn effectively throughout the duration of the course&mdash;as well as in subsequent online courses</p>
                <div class="div-content-box">
                    <h3>Set Your Schedule</h3>
                    <p>Review the class meeting schedule and various due-dates. Then, set aside a regular block of time each week to complete the readings, engage in discussion forums, and prepare questions for the class sessions.</p>
                    <h3>Do a Tech Run</h3>
                    <p>Make sure you understand the technology that is needed for the course. You can find a full list on the Technologies and Support page in the &ldquo;Getting Started&rdquo; Module.</p>
                    <h3>Plan Your Space</h3>
                    <p>Where will you actually do the work for this course? Designate a specific, physical place&mdash;a desk, kitchen table, or corner of the library&mdash;that is free from distractions and available to you consistently throughout the duration of the course.</p>
                </div>
                <h2>Engagement</h2>
                <p>Just like in a face-to-face course, it is crucial that you consistently engage with the instructor(s), the content, and the other students. Make it clear to yourself, the instructor, and your peers that you are truly &ldquo;showing up&rdquo; to this online space.</p>
                <div class="div-content-box">
                    <h3>Speak Up</h3>
                    <p>Speak up early and often during online sessions and in discussion forums. If you are confused, other students likely are as well&mdash;and no one will know unless you say something. If you have an idea or an insight, the instructor wants (and needs!) to hear it in order to assess your learning.</p>
                    <h3>Advocate</h3>
                    <p>Just like in a face-to-face course, <strong>you are your own best advocate.</strong> Leaving questions and confusion to the last weeks of a semester will keep you from excellence; leaving discussion forums, class sessions, and group work solely to the leadership of others will keep you from doing your best work and achieving your educational goals.</p>
                </div>
                <h2>Support</h2>
                <p>Finally,&nbsp;remember that <strong>there is a whole team pulling for you!</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you have a question about the <strong>technology,</strong> submit a support ticket immediately via the <a href="https://sceonline.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SPS Help Desk</a>.</li>
                    <li>If you don&rsquo;t understand the <strong>instructor&rsquo;s expectations</strong> or the <strong>course content,</strong> speak up during the class sessions and in the discussion forums, contribute to the virtual office hours, and reach out to the instructor and/or facilitator.</li>

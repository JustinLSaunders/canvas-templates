        <p>The purpose of this assignment is to guarantee that your webcams and microphones function correctly and that you are fully familiar with how to record in and submit a presentation from the video-conference tool Zoom. It should reduce any anxiety related to preparation for recording a video presentation.</p>
        <h2>Details</h2>
        <p>In preparation for your Final Group Presentation, students will record a brief video in Zoom. The video does not need to be substantial and should be no longer than a minute. The objective of this technology check is to troubleshoot any issues early on.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Your team Host should navigate to zoom, and sign in. Schedule a meeting and email your team members the log in details.</li>
            <li>Log in to the Zoom meeting URL that your team Host provided at the time of your meeting.</li>
            <li>Start recording and take turns so that each team member appears on webcam, says hello, and introduces themselves.</li>
            <li>The group member who will be sharing their screen during the final presentation should do a brief screen share (you can show anything on your screen; the point is to practice this for the final presentation)</li>
            <li>Stop the recording and submit your assignment.</li>
        </ol>

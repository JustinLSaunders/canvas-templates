        <h2>Prepare for Your First Class Session (Adobe Connect)</h2>
        <p><strong>Please follow these best practice guidelines to ensure that you can fully participate in each Class Session:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Use a hard-wired Internet connection.</strong> A hard-wired internet connection (Ethernet) is highly recommended. Weak Wi-Fi will cause issues such as latency, choppy audio, and loss of connection.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Firefox.</strong> Google Chrome currently causes issues with webinar platforms, so we recommend Firefox or another browser for best results.</li>
            <li><strong>Purchase a microphone/headset.</strong> Prepare to talk a lot during our Class Sessions! While many laptops come with built-in mics and speakers, we highly recommend that you use a USB-based headset with microphone, such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-ClearChat-Comfort-Headset-Black/dp/B000UXZQ42">Logitech ClearChat Comfort USB Headset</a>. If you are using a laptop with a built-in microphone, please use headphones or earbuds during the Class Session to avoid echo or feedback. Listening through speakers may cause an echo that disrupts the entire class.</li>
            <li><strong>Conduct a Meeting Diagnostic.</strong> <a href="http://columbia.adobeconnect.com/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm">Conduct a meeting connection diagnostic</a> to make sure that your computer is ready for Adobe Connect meetings. You need a modern web browser, a supported version of Flash, and an Adobe Connect add-in.</li>
            <li><strong>Test your mic and sound in our Adobe Connect Test Room.</strong> You can do so by logging in as a guest to our <a href="https://columbia.adobeconnect.com/student_test/">Adobe Connect Test Room</a>, and following the instructions posted. <a class="instructure_scribd_file instructure_file_link" title="Student_ConnectOverview.pdf" href="https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/35802/files/971749/download?wrap=1" data-api-endpoint="https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/api/v1/courses/35802/files/971749" data-api-returntype="File">We have made a quick-start guide to Adobe Connect for your reference</a>.</li>
